Tool for Dead by Daylight

Make Lobbies Sexy Again

Allows the user to view the steam profile of the killer they're paired with on Dead by Daylight. The user can make notes and if they're ever paired with the same person again they'll know.

It reads the Dead by Daylight log file to find what it needs. It doesn't interfere with the DeadByDaylight executable in any way.
